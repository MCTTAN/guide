1.) Go to developer.vuforia.com.

2.) Under “Target Manager”, click on “Add Database”.

3.) Upload a medium-sized jpg image into the database, and set the width to 5.
    (You can also upload png images, but sometimes they don’t work.)

4.) Check the rating.
    If the image has a 5-star rating, it can easily be detected by a camera.
    The target image should have at least a 3-star rating.

5.) Select the target(s) you want to download and click “Download Database”.

6.) Organize your download into a Unity folder, and open the Unity project 
    that you want to include the datasets in. 

7.) Double-click on the dataset to add it into the current project.

8.) Click on your “ImageTarget” in the “Hierarchy” window and look at the 
    “Inspector” window. Go to “Image Target Behaviour (Script) and add your 
    dataset.
