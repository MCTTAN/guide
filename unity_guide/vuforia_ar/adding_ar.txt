1.) Delete the “Main Camera” in the “Hierarchy” window.

2.) Go to “Assets > Vuforia > Prefabs”, and drag the “ARCamera.prefab” into 
    the “Hierarchy” window.

3.) Drag the “ImageTarget.prefab” onto the “AR Camera” in the “Hierarchy” 
    Window. Make sure it’s a child of “AR Camera”.

4.) Click on the “AR Camera” in the “Hierarchy” window and look at the 
    “Inspector” window. Go to “Vuforia Behaviour Script” and set the “World 
    Center Mode” to “DEVICE_TRACKING”.

5.) Click on “Open Vuforia configuration”. After adding your license key and 
    dataset, go to “Datasets” and checkmark all the options.

6.) Left-click on your “ImageTarget” in the “Hierarchy” window and go to “3D 
    Object > Plane”.
    (Create  plane that’s a child of the image target.)
    
7.) Right-click on your "ImageTarget" and find the “Image Target Behavior” in the inspector window.

8.) Under that tab, look for “Database” and select the database with your defined targets.

9.) Name it / Adjust the location / Adjust the size / etc.
    (In the “Inspector” window, I usually adjust the plane so that it sits 
    above the image target.)

10.) Click on the “Play” button. Make sure that the image target is detected by
    looking for the plane you added.
